## ADS Microservice Template Instructions

Template for an ADS microservice project.

### Usage
1. From the main template repository page, click the "Use This Template" button located above the file list. From the dropdown menu, select "Create a new repository".
2. Name the new repository and add a description. Change the new repository owner and/or permissions as necessary.

    *Naming convention*: The repository name should end with `_service`, e.g. `reference_service`, `metrics_service`.

3. Update this README file: remove this instructions section and update the contents:

    * Replace instances of `<repo_name>` and `<package_name>`, including within the CI status badge
    * Update stub text (e.g. microservice name, description, maintainers, etc.)

4. Rename the directory `package_name`.

    *Naming convention*: The package name should be a shortened form of the repository name.

5. Edit the `pyproject.toml` file:

    * Replace `<repo_name>` and `<package_name>`
    * In the `[project]` section, replace fields as indicated (i.e. name, description, author info)
    * Dependencies go here, instead of in `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt` files

6. Microservice code goes into the `package_name` directory. There's a `tests` sub-directory in there for your unittests.


### Features

The new project will have these:

- Uses `pyproject.toml` for dependencies (note: older ADS microservices may still use `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt` for dependencies)
- Provides `setup.py`
- Testing with Pytest (locally and using Github actions)
- Follows the [black] style guide with [flake8] and [isort]
- Style guide enforced on CI
